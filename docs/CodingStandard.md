# Coding Standard – Car Rental System

It explains how Car Rental System complies with coding standards expected in such a project.

---

## Modularity and Encapsulation

The system is separated into distinct layers — UI, Business, Domain, and Data. There is only one responsibility per class:

* `CarRepository` only deals with saving &
* `CarService` is responsible for rules about cars.
* DTOs and Mappers help to pass data safely without exposing database information.

It is easier to maintain, to test, and to extend.

---

## Performance Considerations

It uses **SQLAlchemy** with SQLite.

* It is a **Singleton** so that the app does not waste time reconnecting whenever it needs a database.
* For a project of this size, setup is fast and efficient.
* It doesn't yet include advanced optimizations such as caching but is set to handle larger improvements down the road.

Performance is good for project scope.

---

## Commenting and Documentation

There are informative **docstrings** to comment about methods and classes. In addition to that, the project supplies:

* A comprehensive **README** file with information about installation and usage.
* Separately **User** and **System Documentation** PDFs.
* **UML diagrams** (Class, Sequence, Use Case) to explicitly present design.

Good documentation is one of the project's strengths.

---

## Indentation and Formatting

It follows **PEP8 conventions**:

* Consistent 4-space indentation.
* Clear and easy-to-read formatting.
* No issues with mixed spaces/tabs.

It's a tidy-looking code.

---

## Naming Conventions

It uses systematic and unambiguous naming throughout:

* Classes also employ **PascalCase** (e.g., `CarService`, `RentalRepository`).
* Functions and methods use **snake\_case** (e.g., `list_users`, `create_rental`).
* Interfaces also contain a prefix `I` (e.g., `ICarService`, `IRentalService`).
* DTOs and Mappers follow a predictable pattern (`UserDto`, `UserMapper`).

It simplifies a code to make it easier to understand.

## Final Evaluation

| Guideline                  | Rating       | Notes                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modularity & Encapsulation | Strong       | Clear division of concerns                                  |
| Performance Considerations | Good         | Optimized with Singleton DBManager, could add caching later |
| Commenting & Documentation | Outstanding  | Extensive documentation and diagrams                        |
| Indentation & Formatting   | Clean        | PEP8-compliant and consistent                               |
| Naming Conventions         | Inconsistent | Random with no overall strategy or standard                 |

**General:** It's a good example of good coding practices. It is easy to read and document as a module. Advanced performance tuning is where it can be improved but for its scope it is good enough.
